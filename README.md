## 📖 Overview
**Harmonic Chaos Box** isn’t just a technical demo — it’s a **music game**.  
You **draw music** into space, and by **walking through the sound field** you harmonize it.  

The outcome is always **music** — layered, evolving, and spatialized.  

Built in **Unity (C#)** with **Audiokinetic Wwise**, this sandbox explores how sound and movement can merge into a playful, interactive composition.

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept
- **Draw sounds into space**: place emitters like brushstrokes on a canvas.  
- **Walk through the sound field**: your position blends harmonies and layers.  
- **Harmonize by moving**: every step creates new relationships between tones.  
- **Chaos becomes order**: the randomness is guided into musical structure.

## 🎵 Features
- **Spatial audio playground** with Unity + Wwise  
- **Dynamic sound emitters** with interactive blending  
- **Procedural layering** for endless evolving textures  
- **Outcome = Music** → every session becomes a generative piece
